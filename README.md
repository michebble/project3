# InTune 

### Connecting people who listen to the song

[InTune](https://intuned.herokuapp.com/) is a proof of concept app that aims to match two people who are listening to same song on the spotify service.  The user can log into the Intune using Spotify OAuth and then start a search for other users.  InTune finds the user's current playing track and compares it against the tracks being played by other InTune users looking for a match.  Once a match is found, both users are given the option of initiating a chat session.  

### Technologies Used
* *Ruby on Rails* - 
This framework solution took care of routing and model creatation to allows us to focus on our server logic.  It also simplified database creatation and restructuring during developement.   

* *Ajax with jQuery* - Ajax was used to poll the database when trying to match users. This meant that the page didn't need to be refreshed and the app could keep track of how long it hand been searching. It is also currently intended to be used to keep the chat session dynamic. 

* [*Spotify API*](https://beta.developer.spotify.com) - We chose Spotify for it's wide distribution and open API.  This made it perfect for a base target for the app. Spotify's OAuth intergration makes for simplified user management, and add they extentsive API opens up avenues for future app functionality and refined logic.
